# Hyperspectral from RGB/Multispectral

This is a MATLAB implementation of the hyperspectral estimation procedure described in the paper "[Sparse Recovery of Hyperspectral Signal from Natural RGB Images](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~obs/Publications/2016-Arad_and_Ben_Shahar-Sparse_Recovery_of_Hyperspectral_Signal_from_Natural_RGB_Images.pdf)" by B. Arad and O. Ben-Shahar. Additional details can be found on the [Project Page](http://icvl.cs.bgu.ac.il/hyperspectral-imaging/) under the Ben-Gurion University [Interdisiplnary Computational Vision Laboratory website](http://icvl.cs.bgu.ac.il/).

## Prerequisites
* MATLAB (Obviously) 
* OMP-Box v10
* KSVD-Box v13

The last two can be found here: http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/software.html

## Getting Started

First, download and install all the above prerequisites. Once OMP-Box and KSVD-Box are installed checkout the repository and review **shredExample.m** for usage examples.

Please note that accurate reconstruction of hyperspectral images depends heavily on the quality of the hyperspectral dictionary used for reconstruction. 

**sample_dict.mat** includes a dictionary precomputed from images in the [BGU ICVL Natural Hyperspectral Image Database](http://icvl.cs.bgu.ac.il/hyperspectral/), and should demonstrate good performance over this data set. 

When comparing performance of HS reconstruction algorithms over the ICVL data set, or any other data set, we recommend that you:
* Optimize the dictionary for your target domain.
* Avoid using test/target images for dictionary construction.

If you are uncertain as to how to do any of the above, feel free to consult the authors.

**sample_hs_im.mat** can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zNfRxtguGe7HCefP0-sROJ0UqlNAPipL/view?usp=sharing) alternatively, you can use any image from the [BGU ICVL Natural Hyperspectral Image Database](http://icvl.cs.bgu.ac.il/hyperspectral/).
